    "In the midterm, you're going to use all of the programming and data management skills you've developed so far to build a risk calculator that pretends to be integrated with a clinical registry.  You'll compute the PRIEST COVID-19 Clinical Severity Score for a series of patients and, based on their risk of an adverse outcome, query a REST web service to find a hospital to transfer them to. The end result of your work will be a list of instructions on where each patient should be discharged: \"home\" if they are below 30% risk and the recommended hospital if they are at or above 30%.\n",

    "Each step in the midterm will build up to form your final solution. Along the way, I've provided plenty of test cases to make sure that you're getting those steps correct.\n",

    "\n",
    "This scoring algorithm can be found [here on the MDCalc website](https://www.mdcalc.com/priest-covid-19-clinical-severity-score#evidence).  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will need to write a function called **priest()** with the following input parameters.  \n",
    " * Sex\n",
    " * Age in years\n",
    " * Respiratory rate in breaths per minute\n",
    " * Oxygen saturation as a percent between 0 and 1\n",
    " * Heart rate in beats per minute\n",
    " * Systolic BP in mmHg\n",
    " * Temperature in degrees C\n",
    " * Alertness as a string description\n",
    " * Inspired Oxygen as as string description\n",
    " * Performance Status as a string description\n",
    "2. The function will need to follow the algorithm provided on the MDCalc website to compute a risk percentage that should be returned as a numeric value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "3. Be sure to use docstring documentation and at least three built-in docstring test cases.\n",
    "4. Assume that the input values that are strings could be any combination of upper or lower case. For example: 'male', 'Male', 'MALE', 'MalE' should all be interpretted by your code as male.\n",
    "5. If any of the inputs are invalid (for example a sex value that is not recognizable as male or female) your code should raise a ValueException that includes a message with the invalid input and which parameter that input was provided as.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTES:\n",
    "1. In the final step there is a rule to convert form raw score to percentile.  In that conversion, 17-25 maps to 59-88% and â‰¥26 maps to >99%.  For our purposes, we want these to be specific % number outputs.  Use the following rule:\n",
    " * If score is between 17 and 25, percentile should be 0.59\n",
    " * If score is greater than or equal to 26, percentile should be 0.99\n"
