    "## Part 1: Reading and using JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **/data** directory, there is a file named **apache_rules.json**.  Copy that to this same folder because you're going to need to make updates to it in part 2. This file contains rules for how to calculate part of the risk scores for something called the [Apache II ICU Mortality Score](https://www.mdcalc.com/apache-ii-score).  In the JSON file, you'll see some basic rules information.  In this part of the assignment, you're going to write a function for calculating one part of the Apache II risk score.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see two parts in the **apache_rules.json** file.  The first is a mapping between \"Organ Failure History\" values and the points associated with each.\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"Organ Failure History\" : {\n",
    "    \"Nonoperative\": 5,\n",
    "    \"Emergency\": 5,\n",
    "    \"Elective\": 2,\n",
    "    \"None\": 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to write a function called **apache_organ_failure(json_file, history)** that takes two strings as parameters.  The first parameter is the name of the JSON file, which should be \"apache_rules.json\". The second parameter will be one of the possible values shown in the \"Organ Failure History\" dictionary:\n",
    "* Nonoperative\n",
    "* Emergency\n",
    "* Elective\n",
    "* None\n",
    "\n",
    "Your **apache_organ_failure()** function should return the associated risk score from the JSON file. That is, you should use the information in JSON file to determine the score.  You **should not** write if/elif statements in your code. Here is an outline of what your code needs to do:\n",
    "1. Read the **json_file** file and load the JSON into a Python dictionary, which I will name **rules** for this explanation\n",
    "2. Get the value from the dictionary associated with **rules\\[\"Organ Failure History\"\\]\\[history\\]**\n",

    "## Part 2: Updating your JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of the Apache II risk score is based on age range. You'll see an example of how to encode range-based rules into JSON.  The **apached_rules.json** file includes the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"Age\": [\n",
    "    { \"min\":  0, \"max\": 45,  \"points\": 0 },\n",
    "    { \"min\": 45, \"max\": 55,  \"points\": 2 },\n",
    "    { \"min\": 75, \"max\": 999, \"points\": 6 }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How you can interpret this is:\n",
    "* If the age is >= 0 and < 45, then return 0 points\n",
    "* If the age is >= 45 and < 55, then return 2 points\n",
    "* If the age is >= 75 and < 999, then return 6 points\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the JSON file is not complete.  The first thing you must do is write the missing rules. The rules provided on the MD Calc web site for [Apache II Score](https://www.mdcalc.com/apache-ii-score#evidence) show two addition rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update the apache_rules.json file with those missing rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you'll need to write a function that uses that information to apply the rules in the JSON file and calculate the score.  Write a function named **apache_age(json_file, age)** that takes two parameters. The JSON file and the age. Your function should use the \"Age\" section of the JSON file to compute the number of points and return that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a way to approach that:\n",
    "* Read the JSON file and load it into a Python dictionary\n",
    "* Loop through the information under the \"Age\" key in the dictionary\n",
    "* For each rule there, compare the **age** parameter with the min and max values in the rule\n",
    "* If the **age** parameter falls between the min and max, return the associated points\n"
